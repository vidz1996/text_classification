"3","One of the biggest worries for owners of small businesses is cash flow. They are often unable to meet payments when they are due because significant sums of money are owed to them."
"3","Most microbusinesses don’t have sufficient long-term or short-term savings so they don’t have a cushion for emergencies, cash flow mismatches and business expansion."
"3","Businesses which track their expenses via Excel are less likely to experience cash flow problems (only 22% report they suffer from this problem)."
"3","Businesses which rely on automated software or have a dedicated consultant or employee tracking expenses are more likely to have cash flow problems than those using Excel (59% and 64% respectively)."
"3","Many businesses fail to pay their taxes quarterly and are forced to pay in one lump sum at the end of the year, further aggravating their cash flow problem."
"3","A large percentage of microbusiness owners have dipped into their household income to solve their business’ cash flow problem, by delaying or reducing a salary, or skipping a paycheck altogether."
"3","Business owners who have significant household and business saving have a greater chance of succeeding, since they are prepared to weather financial setbacks."
"3","But a full 30% say they have no business savings at all and another 38% report having only two months worth of expenses or less saved."
"3","Credit and other financial products and services are difficult to come by, especially for small companies and startups. This fact further contributes to the business’ financial insecurity."

"3","Minority business owners (such as African Americans and Hispanics) are also challenged by lack of a good credit history."

"3","Foreign capital markets are a source for both debt and equity funds, for both foreign subsidiary operations and the general needs of the overall business. Foreign subsidiary capital structures often utilize more local debt when legally and practically available in order to reduce the risk of blockages of earned funds from repatriation to the parent company in another country. In addition, local-currency debt reduces the risk for the parent company if the exchange rates for the local currency change adversely."
"3","Foreign-exchange rates can change dramatically and therefore pose a significant risk for the value of assets held in or future payments from foreign countries. These exposures may be in dealings with third parties or within a company's own foreign subsidiaries. Forward currency contracts or currency options, instruments used to purchase one currency for another currency in the future at guaranteed exchange rates, can be used to protect against such risk. While these contracts are often also used to make profits by managers who believe the exchange rates will change in a manner different from the expectations implicit in the overall currency market, such use should be viewed as risky speculation."

"3","Discounted cash flow (DCF) is the dominant investment-evaluation technique."
"3","Investors can eliminate some risk (unsystematic risk) by diversifying across many regions and sectors."
"3","Some risk (systematic risk), such as that of global recession, cannot be eliminated through diversification. So even a basket with all of the stocks in the stock market will still be risky."
"3","People must be rewarded for investing in such a risky basket by earning returns above those that they can get on safer assets."
"3","The rewards on a specific investment depend only on the extent to which it affects the market basket's risk."
"3","Conveniently, that contribution to the market basket's risk can be captured by a single measure—beta—that expresses the relationship between the investment's risk and the market's risk."

"3","Have you heard of crowdfunding? A way to get the financial boost your business needs to grow, expand or survive harsh economic times, crowdfunding is a new practice often carried out over the Internet. For a more detailed look at the process and what’s involved, check out the story at the link above."
"3","There are no shortcuts to raising cash. Be ware of claims that seem too good to be true. They may either be “opportunities” of questionable authenticity or they are meant for a very specific kind of business and not for you. See the example given by Peter Ireland of an “opportunity” for businesses that may clearly be out of the typical small business startup’s league."

"5","On every continent, in every country throughout the globe, education is slightly different. Although the same debates are had, for example, the best age at which to begin compulsory education and the perfect length for a school day, the answers various nationalities arrive upon vary greatly. It is nothing less than fascinating to delve into this data and it doesn’t take long before you realize that education around the world is ultimately different even though we all pretty much learn the same things."
"5","It is even more fascinating when you think about the fact that countries compare the education level of their population with other countries, something that seems impossible considering the different approaches. Education is a vital part of life, we can all agree on that, and that’s why learning more about it can be really beneficial to you and the way you learn things."

"5","Educational research refers to the systematic collection and analysis of data related to the field of education. Research may involve a variety of methods. Research may involve various aspects of education including student learning, teaching methods, teacher training, and classroom dynamics."
"5","Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy."
"5","Education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship."
"5","A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations. In most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age."
"5","The right to education has been recognized as a human right in a number of international conventions, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights which recognises a right to free, compulsory primary education for all, an obligation to develop secondary education accessible to all, in particular by the progressive introduction of free secondary education, as well as an obligation to develop equitable access to higher education, ideally by the progressive introduction of free higher education. Today, almost 70 million children across the world are prevented from going to school each day. As of 2015, 164 states were parties to the Covenant."
"5","Primary (or elementary) education consists of the first five to seven years of formal, structured education. In general, primary education consists of six to eight years of schooling starting at the age of five or six, although this varies between, and sometimes within, countries."
"5","Various states in the republic of India provide 12 years of compulsory school education based on a national curriculum framework designed by the National Council of Educational Research and Training."
"5","n most contemporary educational systems of the world, secondary education comprises the formal education that occurs during adolescence. It is characterized by transition from the typically compulsory, comprehensive primary education for minors, to the optional, selective tertiary, "postsecondary", or "higher" education (e.g. university, vocational school) for adults."
"5","Secondary education has a longer history in Europe, where grammar schools or academies date from as early as the 16th century, in the form of public schools, fee-paying schools, or charitable educational foundations, which themselves date even further back."
"5","Community colleges offer another option at this transitional stage of education. They provide nonresidential junior college courses to people living in a particular area."
"5","Higher education, also called tertiary, third stage, or postsecondary education, is the non-compulsory educational level that follows the completion of a school such as a high school or secondary school. Tertiary education is normally taken to include undergraduate and postgraduate education, as well as vocational education and training. Colleges and universities mainly provide tertiary education."
"5","Higher education typically involves work towards a degree-level or foundation degree qualification. In most developed countries, a high proportion of the population (up to 50%) now enter higher education at some time in their lives. Higher education is therefore very important to national economies, both as a significant industry in its own right and as a source of trained and educated personnel for the rest of the economy."
"5","University education includes teaching, research, and social services activities, and it includes both the undergraduate level (sometimes referred to as tertiary education) and the graduate (or postgraduate) level (sometimes referred to as graduate school). Universities are generally composed of several colleges. In the United States, universities can be private and independent like Yale University; public and state-governed like the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education; or independent but state-funded like the University of Virginia. A number of career specific courses are now available to students through the Internet."
"5","Vocational education is a form of education focused on direct and practical training for a specific trade or craft. Vocational education may come in the form of an apprenticeship or internship as well as institutions teaching courses such as carpentry, agriculture, engineering, medicine, architecture and the arts."
"5","In the past, those who were disabled were often not eligible for public education. Children with disabilities were repeatedly denied an education by physicians or special tutors. These early physicians (people like Itard, Seguin, Howe, Gallaudet) set the foundation for special education today. They focused on individualized instruction and functional skills."
"5","In 2012, the modern use of electronic educational technology (also called e-learning) had grown at 14 times the rate of traditional learning. Open education is fast growing to become the dominant form of education, for many reasons such as its efficiency and results compared to traditional methods. Cost of education has been an issue throughout history, and a major political issue in most countries today."
"5","Online courses often can be more expensive than face-to-face classes. Out of 182 colleges surveyed in 2009 nearly half said tuition for online courses was higher than for campus-based ones. Many large university institutions are now starting to offer free or almost free full courses such as Harvard, MIT and Berkeley teaming up to form edX. Other universities offering open education are Stanford, Princeton, Duke, Johns Hopkins, Edinburgh, U. Penn, U. Michigan, U. Virginia, U. Washington, and Caltech."
"5","The conventional merit-system degree is currently not as common in open education as it is in campus universities, although some open universities do already offer conventional degrees such as the Open University in the United Kingdom. Presently, many of the major open education sources offer their own form of certificate. Due to the popularity of open education, these new kind of academic certificates are gaining more respect and equal "academic value" to traditional degrees."
"5","In formal education, a curriculum is the set of courses and their content offered at a school or university. As an idea, curriculum stems from the Latin word for race course, referring to the course of deeds and experiences through which children grow to become mature adults. A curriculum is prescriptive and is based on a more general syllabus which merely specifies what topics must be understood and to what level to achieve a particular grade or standard."
"5","An academic discipline is a branch of knowledge which is formally taught, either at the university–or via some other such method. Each discipline usually has several sub-disciplines or branches, and distinguishing lines are often both arbitrary and ambiguous. Examples of broad areas of academic disciplines include the natural sciences, mathematics, computer science, social sciences, humanities and applied sciences."
"5","Educational institutions may incorporate fine arts as part of K-12 grade curricula or within majors at colleges and universities as electives. The various types of fine arts are music, dance, and theatre."
"5","Instruction is the facilitation of another's learning. Instructors in primary and secondary institutions are often called teachers, and they direct the education of students and might draw on many subjects like reading, writing, mathematics, science and history. Instructors in post-secondary institutions might be called teachers, instructors, or professors, depending on the type of institution; and they primarily teach only their specific discipline."
"5","Studies from the United States suggest that the quality of teachers is the single most important factor affecting student performance, and that countries which score highly on international tests have multiple policies in place to ensure that the teachers they employ are as effective as possible."
"5","With the passing of NCLB in the United States (No Child Left Behind), teachers must be highly qualified. A popular way to gauge teaching performance is to use student evaluations of teachers (SETS), but these evaluations have been criticized for being counterproductive to learning and inaccurate due to student bias."
"5","Many countries are now drastically changing the way they educate their citizens. The world is changing at an ever quickening rate, which means that a lot of knowledge becomes obsolete and inaccurate more quickly. The emphasis is therefore shifting to teaching the skills of learning: to picking up new knowledge quickly and in as agile a way as possible. Finnish schools have even begun to move away from the regular subject-focused curricula, introducing instead developments like phenomenon-based learning, where students study concepts like climate change instead."
"5","Education is also becoming a commodity no longer reserved for children. Adults need it too. Some governmental bodies, like the Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra in Finland, have even proposed compulsory life-long education."
"5","Educational technology is the use of both physical hardware and educational theoretics. It encompasses several domains including learning theory, computer-based training, online learning, and where mobile technologies are used, m-learning."
"5","Helping people and children learn in ways that are easier, faster, more accurate, or less expensive can be traced back to the emergence of very early tools, such as paintings on cave walls. Various types of abacus have been used. Writing slates and blackboards have been used for at least a millennium. From their introduction, books and pamphlets have held a prominent role in education."
"5","The Open University in Britain and the University of British Columbia (where Web CT, now incorporated into Blackboard Inc., was first developed) began a revolution of using the Internet to deliver learning, making heavy use of web-based training, online distance learning and online discussion between students. Practitioners such as Harasim (1995) put heavy emphasis on the use of learning networks."
"5","Online college course enrollment has seen a 29% increase in enrollment with nearly one third of all college students, or an estimated 6.7 million students are currently enrolled in online classes. In 2009, 44 percent of post-secondary students in the USA were taking some or all of their courses online, which was projected to rise to 81 percent by 2014."
"5","“Prejudiced” parents are pulling their children from Religious Education classes because they don’t want them learning about Islam, teachers have warned. Mothers and fathers are abusing their right to withdraw children from the classes, and this is hampering schools' attempts to "prepare a child for life in modern Britain", the Association of Teachers and Lecturers’ annual conference heard."
"5","Good quality religious education can develop children's knowledge of the values and traditions of Britain and help foster understanding among different faiths and cultures. Parents have the right to withdraw their children from all or any part of religious education, but schools should make sure that parents who want to do this are aware of the religious education syllabus and its relevance to all pupils."
"5","Kindles and iPads are wonderful things, but many of my friends talked about the smell of a book, finding tickets and receipts that someone had left as a bookmark, echoes of all the people that had been there before. A previous report by the National Literacy Trust (NLT) advised parents to turn to iPads and Kindles to get boys interested in reading, amid fears that large numbers of children are shunning books at a young age."
"5","At least 441 community libraries have closed in the past decade, with a further 149 under threat, the conference was told. The drop in professional librarians has led to a 93 per cent increase in volunteers working in libraries 'resulting in an erosion of a longstanding knowledge and skill base which threatens the quality of the service they provide'."
"5","Libraries are an essential part of school and community life and as relevant now as they ever have been. Tragically, over the past decade the number of school libraries staffed by qualified librarians has declined rapidly."
"5","Reading for pleasure is a skill for life and is consistently shown to be one of the most powerful springboards for children’s engagement with learning, thinking and creating. The Government needs to put libraries, books and reading for pleasure centre-stage in its vision for children and young people."
"5","Official figures show the number of youngsters with special educational needs plans or statements that are awaiting school places has more than doubled in a year. The National Education Union (NEU) claimed that local councils are being "starved" of the money they need for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND), with youngsters forced to stay at home because authorities do not have the cash to provide a suitable education."
"5","Further and higher educational institutions are where people go to further their knowledge in a specific area, and/or to acquire a degree. There are many types of further education such as, community college or university, trade and technical schools, and military colleges/academies. Different degrees include the Associates degree which is a two year program, Bachelors degree which is generally 4–5 years, Masters degree, and PhD."
"5","In Australia a college may be an institution of tertiary education that is smaller than a university, run independently or as part of a university. Following a reform in the 1980s many of the formerly independent colleges now belong to a larger universities."
"5","In India, the term "college" is commonly reserved for institutions that offer degrees at year 12 ("Junior College", similar to American high schools), and those that offer the bachelor's degree; some colleges, however, offer programmes up to PhD level. Generally, colleges are located in different parts of a state and all of them are affiliated to a regional university. The colleges offer programmes leading to degrees of that university."
"5","The first liberal arts and sciences college in India was C. M. S. College Kottayam, Kerala, established in 1817, and the Presidency College, Kolkata, also 1817, initially known as Hindu College. The first college for the study of Christian theology and ecumenical enquiry was Serampore College (1818). The first Missionary institution to impart Western style education in India was the Scottish Church College, Calcutta (1830). The first commerce and economics college in India was Sydenham College, Mumbai (1913)."
"5","Among more modern foundations, the National University of Ireland, founded in 1908, consisted of constituent colleges and recognised colleges until 1997. The former are now referred to as constituent universities – institutions that are essentially universities in their own right. The National University can trace its existence back to 1850 and the creation of the Queen's University of Ireland and the creation of the Catholic University of Ireland in 1854. From 1880, the degree awarding roles of these two universities was taken over by the Royal University of Ireland, which remained until the creation of the National University in 1908 and Queen's University Belfast."
"5","In England, as of August 2016, over 60% of the higher education providers directly funded by HEFCE (208/340) are sixth-form or further education colleges, often termed colleges of further and higher education, along with 17 colleges of the University of London, one university college, 100 universities, and 14 other providers (six of which use 'college' in their name). Overall, this means over two thirds of state-supported higher education providers in England are colleges of one form or another. Many private providers are also called colleges, e.g. the New College of the Humanities and St Patrick's College, London."
"5"," A student-centered environment prioritizes the individual needs of each student and gives them freedom and choice in their learning. Albert Einstein said, "I never teach my pupils; I only attempt to provide the conditions in which they can learn." What changes could you make today to create a classroom environment that works for you and your students?."

But the truth is, international companies have actively started hiring interns for both work-from-home (or virtual) and in-office internships. On an average, over 100 internships are posted on our platform every month. This shows the growing popularity of hiring Indian interns among international employers. Organisations have also started providing accommodation and are ready to bear the entire cost of the visa application for in-office interns, which is quite encouraging to students."

India Today Education spoke to two experienced CBSE Chemistry Board examiners regarding the Chemistry paper analysis who said the Chemistry Class 12 exam paper was very straightforward and then even average students could expect to score well. Barring around three questions which were a little tricky, there was nothing difficult about the exam. We also got talking to a few students who appeared for the exam in a Noida school and found most of them quite happy with their papers."
"5","Students were of the opinion that the paper was quite easy and they didn't face any untoward questions which were absolutely unexpected. Questions were all from the NCERT, said a student. A student who is expecting 95 per cent said that the questions were direct. "If a student has gone through the NCERT thoroughly and practiced from Sample Papers and consulted reference books for a little practice, he or she would face absolutely no problem in solving the paper," said Swati Biswas a Class 12 Chemistry teacher for more than 18 years with around 17 years of Board paper checking experience."

"5","When someone asks as to how a CEO should prepare for an interview, my first reaction is that -- it is always helpful to take a few steps back before that! The Executive Search business is not about getting CEOs to make it through an interview. It's actually about getting CEOs who will be highly successful in the new environment. But can anyone ensure that? The author comes across CEOs professionally all the time and many of them are friends that have known for quite a few years now."
"5","If you have a child studding in the final year of undergrads, chances are that you know he has started accumulating resources to prepare himself for the next stage of entrance examinations. It is very acceptable for our society to see students jump from Engineering to B-School campuses. There is a mindset that encourages students to treat education as a necessary chore and get over with it while they are in the middle of it. The author who has an experience of working with a diverse group of professionals believes that the student majority is not aware of its reasons for doing an MBA."
"5","One should pursue MBA in order to complement existing skill sets, and the only way to evaluate one's existing skill sets is to work for 4 to 5 years before starting your education in business. During professional experiences, people come across moments that inspire them to build an expertise. That expertise will enable them to fulfill their short-term ambition. An MBA programme progresses with the speed of light. Before you jump into it, it will make a lot of sense to get an idea of the companies you want to work with. It is also imperative to find out the kind of roles you want to play in those organisations."

"5","Art and Culture is one of the multiple topics under UPSC syllabus that needs thorough preparation for the Preliminary Examination. It's a topic where a lot of uncertainty is involved. The number of questions asked differ every year. So, one should have a holistic strategy to prepare for this subject. Before starting off with the preparation, one should keep in mind that the questions asked will not require in-depth study but a surface level study. The entire syllabus should be covered as there is no guarantee when it comes to the questions asked in UPSC. Previous year questions, textbooks, mock tests, revision should help you summarize the strategy in short."
"6","Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention."
"6","Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products."
"6","An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of games, where the participant/audience roles may be routinely reversed."
"6","Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion for example with stage magic. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days."
"6","Children's entertainment is centred on play and is significant for their growth and learning. Entertainment is also provided to children or taught to them by adults and many activities that appeal to them such as puppets, clowns, pantomimes and cartoons are also enjoyed by adults."
"6","Comedy is both a genre of entertainment and a component of it, providing laughter and amusement, whether the comedy is the sole purpose or used as a form of contrast in an otherwise serious piece. It is a valued contributor to many forms of entertainment, including in literature, theatre, opera, film and games."
"6","The late Zsa Zsa Gabor would love it that people are still in awe of her glam life. Gabor, who died in December 2016 at 99, was known for being famous for being famous decades before today’s era of people gaining celebrity by way of reality shows or social media. Gabor acted in movies such as 1952’s Moulin Rouge, yet she was better known for her personal life: marrying nine times (once more than Elizabeth Taylor) and being arrested for slapping a Beverly Hills police officer in 1989 and the high-profile trial that followed."
"6","Ocean’s 8 stole our hearts with its jazzy first teaser, and a just-released new trailer for the all-female reboot of Steven Soderbergh‘s popular heist franchise, aptly set to the tune of Linda Ronstadt‘s “You’re No Good,” confirms its status as one of 2018’s must-see megahits in the making."
"6","Ocean’s 8 repeats that magic by uniting a crew of A-list actresses, whose characters received individual social media introductions this week in advance of the trailer premiere. Overseeing the squad is Debbie (Sandra Bullock), ex-con and sister of master criminal Danny Ocean (George Clooney). To get her hands on a stupidly expensive necklace modeled by world-famous celebrity Daphne Kluger (Anne Hathaway), she recruits the talents of her righthand woman Lou (Cate Blanchett), recently retired criminal Tammy (Sarah Paulson), financially strapped seamstress Rose (Helena Bonham Carter), jewelry maker Amita (Mindy Kaling), pickpocket Constance (Awkwafina) and surveillance expert Nine Ball (Rihanna). Their target: the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s annual Met Gala."
"6","Roseanne star Emma Kenney revealed that she is seeking treatment after 'running with a really fast crowd … and doing things that were illegal.' Now, Sara Gilbert, who plays Kenney’s mom on the hit show, is showing support for her TV daughter. “I am so proud of you,” the host of The Talk said on her daytime talk show today. 'We all have demons, and it takes a lot of courage to face them, particularly at 18. I envy you. If I could go back to being 18 and start things to better myself at the pace you’re doing, I would be a better person today."
"6","When an old TV show gets remade, it’s been the tendency in recent years to go dark, grim, and gritty. From Batman (’60s camp classic became morose Dark Knight movies) to Battlestar Galactica (bad utopian ’70s sci-fi became good dystopian sci-fi), the idea is to complicate the original premise and go for a realism signified by a somber tone and a cynical, knowing air. Knowing this, the new version of Lost in Space seems to be trying to have it both ways, and loses in the process."
"6","The new Netflix series is an update of the enjoyably junky CBS show that ran from 1965 to 1968. That one gave us a clever performance by Jonathan Harris as fussy Dr. Zachary Smith and the catchphrase “Danger, Will Robinson,” uttered by a robot in reference to child actor Billy Mumy’s Will. The concept of the show, as conceived by creator Irwin Allen (the producer who gave the world The Towering Inferno), can be reduced to its pitch-phrase: “Swiss Family Robinson in outer space”."
"6","The new Lost has been constructed by writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, a screenwriting team who’ve written gloomy fantasy films like Dracula Untold and The Last Witch Hunter. Feature films may be their true calling, because handing Sazama and Sharpless 10 episodes of Netflix time has resulted in some very slow going."
"6","On Thursday, Laura Ingraham suddenly apologized for insulting and ridiculing school-shooting survivor David Hogg — but only after she began losing advertisers for her Fox News show and under the threat of losing more. The previous day, Ingraham felt not a twinge of decency when she tweeted an insult about Hogg getting rejections from a number of colleges, sneering that he was whining about it. In response, Hogg called for an advertiser boycott of The Ingraham Angle. By late afternoon, Nestle, Hulu, Wayfair, Johnson & Johnson, Expedia, and TripAdvisor, and others had yanked ads from her show."
"6","Superman as created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster in the 1930s was an infant alien sent from “a distant planet.” That planet was eventually given a name, Krypton, and the infant Kryptonian, Kal-El, gained superpowers when placed in Earth’s atmosphere: thus the name Superman. Over the years, subsequent DC Comics writers elaborated on this origin story. Needing more plots to continue the adventures of Superman, a backstory was crafted, beginning with the establishment of Jor-El as Superman’s Kryptonian scientist-father."
"6","The hero of Krypton is Superman’s grandfather, Seg-El, as embodied by young-hunk actor Cameron Cuffe. The show is set on the planet Krypton, and the predominant color palette is … dark. Everyone strides purposefully down long, dark corridors that resemble the interior of a chic Manhattan hotel. Quite a few scenes are set in a low-lit bar where drinks are poured and fistfights occur and jokes are made by a jokey bartender who’s also a pal of Seg-El’s. As for Seg himself, his parentage may be noble, but the show is careful to make him a young man of action — that’s him throwing punches during a number of those bar fights."
"6","Expectations can be a funny thing when it comes to movies: The more eagerly we anticipate a project, the more likely it is to disappoint. When Disney resolved to remake “Wrinkle,” this time with a much bigger budget, a better director (Ava DuVernay, fresh off “Selma”), and the benefit of a quantum leap forward in visual effects technology, fans of the novel had every reason to hope the studio might get it right — plus, there was the added excitement of seeing a woman of color take the helm of such a big tentpole. Let this be a warning: Keep your expectations in check, and you might be pleasantly surprised."
"6","DuVernay was a publicist before she was a filmmaker, and she’s doing both herself and the movie a disservice by suggesting that “Wrinkle” solves Hollywood’s representation problem. Granted, it’s an encouraging start. But despite such bold choices as casting Oprah Winfrey as an all-wise celestial being and rejecting the antiquated assumption that the lead characters ought to be white, “A Wrinkle in Time” is wildly uneven, weirdly suspenseless, and tonally all over the place, relying on wall-to-wall music to supply the missing emotional connection and trowel over huge plot holes."
"6","Sunny Leone and husband Daniel Weber are celebrating their seventh wedding anniversary today. In the morning, an anniversary post arrived from the actress and it carried a wonderful message for Daniel.

The poster's backdrop has a gothic feel to it."
"6","A magazine is a publication, usually a periodical publication, which is printed or electronically published (sometimes referred to as an online magazine). Magazines are generally published on a regular schedule and contain a variety of content. They are generally financed by advertising, by a purchase price, by prepaid subscriptions, or a combination of the three. At its root, the word "magazine" refers to a collection or storage location. In the case of written publication, it is a collection of written articles. This explains why magazine publications share the word root with gunpowder magazines, artillery magazines, firearms magazines, and, in French, retail stores such as department stores."

And the second schedule of the film will now go on floors by April end."
"6","Many newbies will happily give anything to make their big Bollywood debut with Dharma Productions. Known for larger-than-life films, Karan Johar is a name to reckon with in Bollywood, and when he introduces a new face, many sit up and take notice. Six years ago, when he decided to launch Mahesh Bhatt's daughter with Student Of The Year, all eyes were on this new star kid. But Alia Bhatt was more or less written off within a few days of her big Bollywood debut. Her acting was no match for her good looks, and Alia was declared just another star kid with a cute face in Bollywood."
"6","Bepannaah opened to a phenomenal response on the ratings charts and did well for two weeks. The show however couldn't sustain its position among the top five shows in the coming weeks. Nevertheless, the show's fans shouldn't be disheartened as the makers have too many upcoming twists in store to keep you hooked. The romantic thriller doesn't just boasts of good-looking faces but a crisp storyline."
"6","Celebrated Hollywood filmmaker Christopher Nolan is in Mumbai along with his wife Emma Thomas to to be a part of debates that involve talking about the importance of celluloid in the digital era, along with film preservation and restoration. The Oscar - nominated director, who's filmography boasts of countless hits including Memento (2000), the thriller Insomnia (2002), Leonardo Dicaprio starrer Inception (2010), Interstellar (2014); and more recently Dunkirk (2017), is on a mission reintroduce the old filming style, which is under threat due to the digitization of cinema."
"7","The total forest and tree cover of the country is 79.42 million hectare which is 24.16 percent of the geographical area of the country. As compared to the assessment of 2013, there is an increase of 3,775 sq km in the forest cover of the country. The majority of the increase in the forest cover has been observed in open forest category mainly outside forest areas, followed by Very Dense Forest."
"7","The maximum increase in forest cover has been observed in Tamil Nadu (2501 sq. km.) followed by Kerala (1317 sq. km.) and Jammu & Kashmir (450 sq km). The North-eastern states account for one-fourth of the country's forest cover."
"7","Madhya Pradesh has the largest forest cover of 77,462 sq. km. in terms of area in the country followed by Arunachal Pradesh with forest cover of 67,248 sq. km and Chhattisgarh – 55,586 sq km."
"7","In terms of percentage of forest cover with respect to total geographical area, Mizoram with 88.93 percent had the highest forest cover in terms of percentage of forest cover to Geographical area followed by Lakshadweep with 84.56 percent."
"7","15 States/UTs had above 33 percent of the geographical area under forest cover. Out of these States and UTs, seven States/Union Territories – Mizoram, Lakshadweep, Andaman & Nicobar Island, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Meghalaya and Manipur have more than 75 per cent forest cover while 8 states – Tripura, Goa, Sikkim, Kerala, Uttarakhand, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Chhattisgarh and Assam have forest cover is between 33 percent to 75 percent."
"7","The total growing stock of India’s forest and trees outside forests is estimated as 5,768 million cum which comprises 4,195 million cum inside the forests and 1573 million cum outside the forests."
"7","Forest: Includes all lands classed as forests under any legal enactment dealing with forests or administered as forests."
"7","Area under Non-agricultural Uses: Includes all lands occupied by buildings, roads and railways or under water, e.g. river, and canals and other lands used for non-agriculture purpose."
"7","Barren and un-cultivable land: Includes all barren and un-cultivable land like mountains, desert etc."
"7","Permanent pastures and other grazing lands: Includes all grazing lands where they are permanent pastures and meadows or not. Village common grazing land is included under this head."
"7","Land under miscellaneous tree crops and groves etc: This includes all cultivable land, which is not included in ‘Net Area Sown’ but is put to some agricultural uses. Lands under Casuarina trees, thatching grasses, bamboo bushes, and other groves for fuel, etc which are not included under ‘Orchards’ are classified under this category."
"7","Culturable Wasteland: This includes lands available for cultivation. Such lands may be either fallow or covered with shrubs or jungles, which are not put to any use. Land once cultivated but not cultivated for five years in succession should be include in this category at the end of the five years."
"7","Fallow lands other than current fallows: This includes all lands, which were taken up for cultivation but are temporarily out of cultivation for a period of not less than one year and not more than five years."
"7","Current Fallows: This represents cropped area, which are kept fallow during the current year. For example, if any seeding area is not cropped in the same year again, it may be treated as current fallows."
"7","Net Area Sown: This represents the total area sown with crops and orchards. Area sown more than once in the same year is counted only once."
"7","About 45 percent of India's land is degraded due to erosion, soil acidity, alkalinity and salinity, water logging and wind erosion. The prime causes of land degradation are deforestation, unsustainable farming, mining and excessive groundwater extraction. However, over two-thirds of the degraded 147 million hectares can be regenerated quite easily. India's forest cover is also gradually increasing (currently about 21%)."
"7","Air pollution is increasing in all its cities. The level of respirable suspended particulate matter (the small pieces of soot and dust that get inside the lungs) had gone up in all the 50 cities across India. The main causes of urban air pollution were vehicles and factories."
"7","India is using 75 percent of the water it can use, and it has "just enough for the future if it is careful. Lack of proper pricing of water for domestic usage, poor sanitation, unregulated extraction of groundwater by industry, discharge of toxic and organic wastewater by factories, inefficient irrigation and overuse of chemical fertilisers and pesticides are the main causes of water problems in the country."
"7","While India remains one of the world's 17 "megadiverse" countries in terms of the number of species it houses, 10 percent of its wild flora and fauna are on the threatened list. The main causes for this were habitat destruction, poaching, invasive species, overexploitation, pollution and climate change."
"7","India contributes only about five percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions that are leading to climate change. However, about 700 million Indians directly face the threat of global warming today, as it affects farming, makes droughts, floods and storms more frequent and more severe and is raising the sea level."
"7","Much of the destruction of the Earth, its plants and its animals could be decreased if people all over the world would Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. Everyone also needs to decrease the amount of energy and fuel that is used."
"7","Deserts are taking over much of the land area on the Earth. Droughts, the spread of building projects, and the cutting down of our forests has led to this problem."
"7","Environment is the sum total of what is around something or someone. It includes living things and natural forces. The environment of living things provides conditions for development and growth, as well as of danger and damage. See the fact file below for more information about the environment."
"7","As the sea levels have risen over the years, so too have the coral reefs. Some small islands became submerged, which provided optimal spaces for coral to grow over top of."
"7","The World Heritage Area for the Great Barrier Reef includes 70 bioregions."
"7","Saltwater crocodiles live in areas surrounding the reef, as well as 30 species of dolphins and porpoises."
"7","Ocean warming causes coral bleaching, which is when coral expels the algae that live inside them. This is caused when the water temperature becomes too warm."
"7","Farming fertilizer runoff can also seep into the water and pollute the reef by releasing harmful chemicals."
"7","The Northern Hemisphere includes all of North America, the northern parts of South America, about two-thirds of Africa, all of Asia excluding parts of Indonesia and all of Europe."
"7","Earth Day is a day that was created to promote awareness and appreciation for the Earth’s environment."
"7","There is no governmental agency that is in charge of Earth Day, but many local and non-profit groups throughout the world help to organize events and activities."
"7","Most schools have activities planned for Earth Day to help children realize how important it is to take care of the environment."
"7","Many organizations celebrate Earth Day by picking up trash on the road side, cleaning up vacant lots, cleaning the banks of lakes and rivers, and making sure that beaches and parks are free from litter and debris."
"7","The theme for Earth Day 2017 is Environmental and Climate Literacy’. The campaign seeks to educate people around the world about the causes and consequences of climate change and how they can help to lessen the effects."
"7","Climate change describes a change in global climate patterns attributed largely to the increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere produced by the use of fossil fuels."
"7","Increasing the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere intensifies the greenhouse effect and causes global temperatures to rise. The greenhouse effect is the process by which heat in the Earth’s atmosphere is trapped by various gases called greenhouse gases."
"7","These gases include carbon dioxide, water vapour, methane, nitrous oxide e.t.c. Without the greenhouse effect the Earth would be 30 degrees cooler than it is today. Intensifying the effect by the addition of excess greenhouse gases leads to global warming."
"7","Global warming is an increase in the overall temperature of the Earth’s atmosphere. Global warming has severe consequences such as sea level rise, more frequent and powerful storms, drought and higher wildlife extinction rates."
"7","Reducing the effects of global warming includes reducing fossil fuel use, conserving electricity, utilizing renewable energy technologies and replanting and protecting forests."
"7","A desert is a dry biome. It gets less than 25 cm (about 9.8 inches) of rainfall a year. Deserts areas cover about 33% of the land on Earth and land surfaces include stones, sand dunes or snow. See the fact file below for more information about deserts."
"7","Deserts are the driest biome. They have little vegetation and the least amount of rain."
"7","The world’s deserts are generally found in four areas: in the subtropics; in continental interior areas at middle latitudes; on the leeward side of mountain ranges; and along coastal areas. Most of the earth’s greatest deserts are found in the subtropics. The subtropical deserts center on the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. Deserts cover about one-fifth of all the land in the world."
"7","Deserts are formed when the mountains along the edge of the desert prevent the rain getting there. The rain stays on the other side of the mountain and in many cases creates a rainforest."
"7","The world’s largest deserts are the Sahara in North Africa, the Gobi in Mongolia and China, the Kalahari in South Africa, the Great Victoria in Australia, and the Great Sandy in Australia."
"7","The many different kinds of cacti are the most common desert plants. Desert plants need to be able to collect and store water ."
"7","There are also many different kinds of animals that live in the desert. Most of these animals are nocturnal, which means they sleep during the day when the temperature is the hottest, and they hunt at night when the desert cools down."
"7","The Atlantic Ocean’s hurricane season occurs from mid-August to late October and averages five to six hurricanes per year. Better technology allows scientists to track the storm and predict its path. Warnings can be given to residents so they can prepare their property for the storm and/or evacuate the area."
"7","When hurricanes come onto land, the heavy rain, strong winds and heavy waves can damage buildings, trees and cars. The heavy waves are called a storm surge. Once a hurricane moves onto the land it begins to lose energy."
"7","Hurricanes rotate in a counter-clockwise direction around the eye. The eye of the hurricane is a calm area, however, the rotating storm clouds create the “eyewall”, which is the most destructive part of the storm."
"7","A volcano is a mountain that opens downward toward a pool of molten rock, which is called magma. This all happens below the surface of the earth. So a volcano is essentially hole in the Earth from which molten rock and gas erupt."
"7","As pressure in the molten rock builds up it needs to escape somewhere. So it forces its way up through fissures, which are narrow cracks in the earths crust. Once the magma erupts through the earth’s surface it’s called lava."
"7","There are around 1,510 active volcanoes in the world. We currently know of more which are under the oceans. At any given time, there is an average of about 20 volcanoes that are erupting."
"7","he Earth’s crust is made up of huge slabs called plates, which fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. These plates sometimes move. When two plates collide, one section slides on top of the other, the one beneath is pushed down. Magma is squeezed out."
"7","Most volcanoes will form over many thousands of years. However, they can sometimes appear very quickly. A volcano called Paricutin appeared in a Mexican field in 1943 and grew to 60ft in a week. Within a year, Paricutin was 1,000 feet tall."
"7","here might be as many as 10,000 volcanoes underneath the ocean. The most famous ocean volcano is Surtsey. Located off the coast of Iceland, it erupted in 1963 and formed a new island which is now home to thousands of seagulls and seals."
"7","Nearly 5 million people live close to active volcanoes. One of the most famous volcanoes is Mount Vesuvius in Italy. Several million people live close to this dangerous, active volcano."
"7","Both Hawaii and Iceland are volcanic islands and have black beaches. The sand on these islands is made from the hot lava when it cools down, creating a rock called basalt."
"7","In volcanic areas, like Iceland, the heat from volcanoes is used to produce hot water and runs power plants. In Japan, it is common for people to bathe in warm volcanic sand. It is supposed to have healing qualities to cure illness and skin conditions."
"7","There are two kinds of magnets: Permanent Magnets, also called hard magnets, and Induced Magnets (called temporary or soft magnets). Permanent magnets always have their magnetic force. induced magnets are ones that become temporarily magnetized when brought near a permanent magnet. For example, if a magnet is used to pick up a paper clip, the paper clip will become magnetized too, and it will be able to pick up another paper clip. However, once the permanent magnet is removed, the paper clips lose their magnetic properties."
"7","Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change. Pollution can take the form of chemical substances or energy, such as noise, heat or light. Pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants. Pollution is often classed as point source or nonpoint source pollution. In 2015, pollution killed 9 million people in the world."
"7","Air pollution has always accompanied civilizations. Pollution started from prehistoric times, when man created the first fires. According to a 1983 article in the journal Science, "soot" found on ceilings of prehistoric caves provides ample evidence of the high levels of pollution that was associated with inadequate ventilation of open fires. Metal forging appears to be a key turning point in the creation of significant air pollution levels outside the home. Core samples of glaciers in Greenland indicate increases in pollution associated with Greek, Roman, and Chinese metal production, but at that time the pollution was comparatively small and could be handled by nature."
"7","Air pollution: the release of chemicals and particulates into the atmosphere. Common gaseous pollutants include carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and nitrogen oxides produced by industry and motor vehicles. Photochemical ozone and smog are created as nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons react to sunlight. Particulate matter, or fine dust is characterized by their micrometre size PM10 to PM2.5."
"7","Light pollution: includes light trespass, over-illumination and astronomical interference."
"7","Littering: the criminal throwing of inappropriate man-made objects, unremoved, onto public and private properties."
"7","Carbon dioxide (CO2) - Because of its role as a greenhouse gas it has been described as "the leading pollutant" and "the worst climate pollution". Carbon dioxide is a natural component of the atmosphere, essential for plant life and given off by the human respiratory system. This question of terminology has practical effects, for example as determining whether the U.S. Clean Air Act is deemed to regulate CO2 emissions.[8] CO2 currently forms about 405 parts per million (ppm) of earth's atmosphere, compared to about 280 ppm in pre-industrial times,[9] and billions of metric tons of CO2 are emitted annually by burning of fossil fuels.[10] CO2 increase in earth's atmosphere has been accelerating."
"7","The total energy of a system can be subdivided and classified into potential energy, kinetic energy, or combinations of the two in various ways. Kinetic energy is determined by the movement of an object -- or the composite motion of the components of an object - and potential energy reflects the potential of an object to have motion, and generally is a function of the position of an object within a field or may stored in the field itself."
"7","Noise pollution (also known as sound pollution) is harmful to the brain and hearing of all animals and humans. This includes the sound of vehicles, loud speakers, airplanes, jets, train horns etc. Noise pollution can cause ear problems or even permanent deafness, especially to older people. It also causes brain related problems."
"7","Thermal pollution is the harmful release of heated liquid into a body of water or heat released into the air as a waste product of a business."
"7","As pollution grows, ways to combat it have grown too. Solar energy and wind energy give people other ways to power their homes. When people use these alternative forms of energy, they put less carbon dioxide into the environment."
"7","Sustainability is the key to prevent or reduce the effect of environmental issues. There is now clear scientific evidence that humanity is living unsustainably, and that an unprecedented collective effort is needed to return human use of natural resources to within sustainable limits. For humans to live sustainably, the Earth's natural resources must be used at a rate at which they can be replenished (and by limiting global warming)."
"7","Information pollution (also referred to as "info pollution") is the contamination of information supply with irrelevant, redundant, unsolicited and low-value information.[1] The spread of useless and undesirable information can have a detrimental effect on human activities. It is considered one of the adverse effects of the information revolution."
"7","Sound pollution from ships, sonar devices, and oil rigs can disrupt the migration, communication, hunting, and reproduction patterns of many marine animals, such as whales and dolphins."
"7","Humans create over 1.3 billion tons of trash a year, more of it in the United States (254 million tons a year) than anywhere else in the world."
"7","Researchers have discovered extremely high levels of toxic industrial pollutants in the deepest and remotest parts of the ocean."
"7","According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 6,400 people die every year in Mexico City and more than 1 million suffer from permanent breathing problems due to air pollution."
"7","Lake Karachay, located in the southern Ural Mountains in Russia, is considered to be the most polluted spot on earth after it was used for decades as a dumping site for nuclear waste. Spending just 5 minutes near the lake unprotected can kill a person. In the 1960s, the lake dried out and radioactive dust carried by the wind irradiated half a million people with radiation equivalent to the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima."
"7","Antarctica is the cleanest place on Earth and is protected by strong anti-pollution laws."
"7","People who litter are more likely to be men between 18-34 years old, smokers, people who eat at fast food places at least two times per week, and drive more than 50 miles a day."
"7","If all the tires Americans throw away each year were stacked on top of each other, the pile would reach 32,000 miles high—a greater distance than the circumference of the earth at the equator (24,901 miles)."
"7","In Florida alone, hundreds of thousands of sea turtle hatchlings are killed due to light pollution. Hatchlings gravitate toward brighter lights, and, consequently, crawl toward city lights rather than to the sea. Additionally, light pollution affects the breeding and migration of many types of birds."
"7","Global warming is not only shrinking the polar icecaps, it is also shrinking the genitals of polar bears in east Greenland."
"7","14 billion pounds (6B Kg.) of garbage are dumped into the ocean every year. Most of it is plastic."
"7","Almost a third of San Francisco's air pollution comes from China."
"7","Breathing the air of Beijing has the same health risks as smoking 21 cigarettes a day."
"7","Rock or stone is a natural substance, a solid aggregate of one or more minerals or mineraloids. For example, granite, a common rock, is a combination of the minerals quartz, feldspar and biotite. The Earth's outer solid layer, the lithosphere, is made of rock."
"7","Metamorphic rocks are formed by subjecting any rock type—sedimentary rock, igneous rock or another older metamorphic rock—to different temperature and pressure conditions than those in which the original rock was formed. This process is called metamorphism, meaning to "change in form". The result is a profound change in physical properties and chemistry of the stone."
"7","Igneous rock (derived from the Latin word igneus, meaning of fire, from ignis meaning fire) is formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. This magma may be derived from partial melts of pre-existing rocks in either a planet's mantle or crust. Typically, the melting of rocks is caused by one or more of three processes: an increase in temperature, a decrease in pressure, or a change in composition."
"7","Earth science generally recognizes 4 spheres, the lithosphere, the hydrosphere, the atmosphere, and the biosphere[3] as correspondent to rocks, water, air, and life respectively. Some scientists include, as part of the spheres of the Earth, the cryosphere (corresponding to ice) as a distinct portion of the hydrosphere, as well as the pedosphere (corresponding to soil) as an active and intermixed sphere. Earth science (also known as geoscience, the geosciences or the Earth Sciences), is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet Earth."
"7","A river is a natural watercourse,[7] usually freshwater, flowing toward an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river. A few rivers simply flow into the ground and dry up completely before reaching another body of water."
"7","A lake (from Latin lacus) is a terrain feature, a body of water that is localized to the bottom of basin. A body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, is not part of an ocean, and is larger and deeper than a pond."
"7","The ozone layer of the Earth's atmosphere plays an important role in depleting the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As DNA is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes."
"7","An ecosystem (also called as environment) is a natural unit consisting of all plants, animals and micro-organisms (biotic factors) in an area functioning together with all of the non-living physical (abiotic) factors of the environment."
"7","Biomes are terminologically similar to the concept of ecosystems, and are climatically and geographically defined areas of ecologically similar climatic conditions on the Earth, such as communities of plants, animals, and soil organisms, often referred to as ecosystems. Biomes are defined on the basis of factors such as plant structures (such as trees, shrubs, and grasses), leaf types (such as broadleaf and needleleaf), plant spacing (forest, woodland, savanna), and climate. Unlike ecozones, biomes are not defined by genetic, taxonomic, or historical similarities. Biomes are often identified with particular patterns of ecological succession and climax vegetation."
"7","Wilderness is generally defined as a natural environment on Earth that has not been significantly modified by human activity. The WILD Foundation goes into more detail, defining wilderness as: "The most intact, undisturbed wild natural areas left on our planet - those last truly wild places that humans do not control and have not developed with roads, pipelines or other industrial infrastructure."
"7","Decomposition is the process by which organic substances are broken down into simpler matter. The process is a part of the nutrient cycle and is essential for recycling the finite matter that occupies physical space in the biosphere. Bodies of living organisms begin to decompose shortly after death. Animals, such as worms, also help decompose the organic materials."
"7","Sunlight is the light and energy that comes from the Sun. When this energy reaches the earth's surface, it is called insolation. What we experience as sunlight is actually solar radiation. It is the radiation and heat from the Sun in the form of electromagnetic waves."
"7","Without sunlight, there could be no life on Earth. Plants need sunlight for the process of photosynthesis. During photosynthesis the plants use the energy of the sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide, to create glucose (sugar). The glucose can later be used by the plant for energy or animals eat the plant and the glucose in it. Plants need sunlight to grow green. Without enough sunlight but with enough water, the plant grows very tall very quickly, but looks yellow and dehydrated, although when touched, the leaves are very moist."
"7","Solar radiation can be both good and bad for a person's health. When in the light, the human body uses the ultraviolet part of sunlight to make its own Vitamin D. Without sunscreen too much ultraviolet light can cause sunburn and skin cancer. Sun angle makes difference in seasons on Earth as well as in the length of day and night.[1] A high angle makes the tropics hot, and a low angle makes the arctic cold."
"7","Galton did not oppose nature to nurture as two alternatives. The phrase 'nature vs nurture' has been rightly criticized for its over-simplification. Almost all writers have realised that both play a part in our make-up. One who, at first sight, seemed to think humans got their 'mind' from nurture (the tabula rasa or blank slate theory) was philosopher John Locke. He, however, was only concerned with how we acquire knowledge from sense data."
"7","A non-renewable resource is a natural resource that is used up faster than it can be made by nature. It cannot be produced, grown or generated on a scale which can sustain how quickly it is being consumed. Once it is used up, there is no more available for future needs. Also considered non-renewable are resources that are consumed much faster than nature can create them. Fossil fuels (such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas), types of nuclear power (uranium) and certain rexamples. Resources such as timber (when harvested sustainably) or metals (which can be recycled) are considered renewable resources."
"8","Avoid adding table salt to the meals you prepare at home. Instead, swap table salt for a high quality Himalayan rock salt or Celtic sea salt and use sparingly."
"8","Drink plenty of pure, filtered water each day to flush excess sodium out of your system."
"8","Reduce your sodium intake by replacing high-sodium processed foods with fresh fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and healthy fats."
"8","Limit eating at restaurants, which are notorious for adding large quantities of salt to dishes."
"8","Avoid high sodium sauces such as soy sauce or oyster sauce."
"8","The single best way to reduce your sodium intake is to prepare as many of your meals at home as possible, from fresh, whole food ingredients. This way you can control the amount of sodium that ends up in your diet."
"8","Consuming extra calories from junk food is the quickest way to promote obesity and put stress on your internal organs, which can cause serious health complications down the road."
"8","The best way to reduce your caloric intake is to avoid “empty” calorie foods – especially soda and fast foods, which are extremely calorie dense and wreak havoc on your system."
"8","protein, beans, and legumes - You may be surprised at how full you feel from these foods, without the need for calories from any junk food sources."
"8","If you have eggs for breakfast, add some steamed asparagus to the side."
"8","If you love your meat and potatoes for dinner, start your meal with a large green salad and add a heaping pile of steamed broccoli to your plate, too (just be sure to eat it before filling up on the other foods)."
"8","There are plenty of convenient food journal smartphone apps that will help you track your food intake – including your veggies. Or, you could just keep an organizer or “note” app that allows you to check off each day when you’ve had 5 servings of vegetables."
"8","I’ve said it before, but green smoothies are the easiest way to get 5 servings of vegetables (and more) in at once."
"8","Ensure the produce and meat you eat is thoroughly washed and cooked."
"8","Eat a diet high in fiber from fresh fruits and vegetables. Fiber is one of the best ways to help lower your LDL cholesterol levels because it helps block the absorption of LDL cholesterol in the digestive tract (18)."
"8","Cooking oils are a major source of “unhealthy” fats in today’s American diet. To reduce your consumption of these fats, replace your cooking oils with stable healthy fats, such as coconut oil. Avoid cooking with delicate fats such as olive oil, as they have a much lower smoke point and can turn into trans-fats quickly when heated with high temperatures."
"8","Limit your intake of refined carbohydrates. Although carbohydrates can seem irrelevant to saturated fats, the truth is, refined carbs can actually contribute to reducing your HDL levels (the good cholesterol), while increasing your triglycerides. This is just as bad of an effect as eating too many unhealthy saturated fats."
"8","Conventionally prepared fruit juice is extremely high in sugar, and often contains more grams of sugar per serving than a can of pop. Not surprisingly, many “healthy” juice companies are owned by big companies such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi."
"8","Knowing that pre-prepared fruit juice is often no better than drinking a can of soda (which has the equivalent of nearly eight teaspoons of white sugar) can help prevent you from over consuming calories from refined sugar, which leads to weight gain and wreaks havoc on your blood sugar levels and internal organs."
"8","Green smoothies differ from green juices because the vegetables still have their fiber intact."
"8","While it’s broken down by a blender and made easier to digest, the fiber still helps slow the release of the sugar from fruits and vegetables into your bloodstream. Therefore, green smoothies also have less of a negative impact on your blood sugar levels, and support your health with essential vitamins and minerals."
"8","But a heavily processed gluten-free food is still no healthier than a heavily processed gluten-containing food."
"8","Make your own salad dressings at home with quality vegetable oils, such as organic extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar, organic raw honey and dijon mustard."
"8","When dining out, request lemon wedges, vinegar and olive oil for your salad dressing instead of the options provided by the restaurant."
"8","oday, whole wheat nearly has the same glycemic load as white bread, which means it still spikes and crashes your blood sugar levels the same way white sugar does (29)."
"8","Instead of whole wheat, choose minimally processed gluten-free whole grains if you do choose to include grains in your diet. Buckwheat, brown rice, teff, and quinoa (which is actually more of a seed) are the best choices, since they’re packed full of vitamins, minerals, and fiber, which stabilize blood sugar levels rather than spiking them."
"8","Avoid using agave. Instead opt for small amounts of pure, organic maple syrup, organic coconut nectar, pure green leaf stevia, or local raw honey. All of these sweetener alternatives can be found at your local health food store, or purchased online through health food retailers."
"8","Today, many people have severe intolerances to wheat – especially to gluten, the protein found in wheat. More research is needed to confirm whether or not gluten sensitivities are related to wheat-breeding (33)."
"8","I personally recommend limiting your grain intake due to the impact grains have on blood sugar levels. But if you do choose to include small amounts of grains in your diet, try to replace wheat with gluten-free whole grains (such as buckwheat or amaranth) wherever possible."
"8","Chinese cabbage has anti-inflammatory properties."
"8","It is an excellent source of folic acid."
"8","Kale eases lung congestion and is beneficial to the stomach, liver and immune system."
"8","Onions are an excellent antioxidant, and they contain anti-allergy, antiviral and antihistamine properties."
"8","Peanuts contain beneficial protein, but many people are allergic to them and find them hard to digest."
"8","Pumpkin seeds are high in zinc, which is good for the prostate and building the immune system."
"8","Sweet potatoes are not related to the potato nor the yam--they are actually a member of the morning glory family."
"8","Zucchini and other summer squash varieties contain vitamins A and C."
"8","To prevent exceeding your daily recommended intake of sodium and refined grains, request that no salt be added to your dish (avoid brines and marinades, which are often high in table salt) and skip out on the bread that’s typically offered with a meal. If possible, ask for extra vegetables or a small side salad."
"8","Tracking your meals in a food journal to see how often you’re consuming fruit, vegetables and healthy fats."
"8","Avoid processed foods such as chips, french fries, and pretzels. Salted nuts should also be avoided."
"8","Avoid adding table salt to the meals you prepare at home. Instead, swap table salt for a high quality Himalayan rock salt or Celtic sea salt and use sparingly."
"8","Cherries are a member of the rose family."
"8","Apples are made of 25% air, which is why they float."
"8","Cabbage is 91% water."
"8","Lemons contain more sugar than strawberries."
"8","Honey is the only edible food that never goes bad."
"8","Neither strawberries, blackberries nor raspberries are actual berries."
"8","Almonds are a member of the peach family."

"8","You should never order your milk based coffee drinks “extra hot.” There is a ton of science involved in coffee and the steaming of milk for milk based drinks is no exception. A properly steamed milk will have a rich velvety texture that is naturally sweet. When costumers request to steam the milk longer to get a hotter temperature, the natural sugars of the milk begin to breakdown losing some of the sweetness and changing the texture of the milk. Instead of rich and velvety, you get thin and dry."
"8","Coffee is second most traded commodity on earth. Oil is the first."

Acids add a sharpness to the background taste and enhance the thirst-quenching experience by stimulating saliva flow. The most common acid in soft drinks is citric acid, which has a lemony flavor. Acids also reduce pH levels, mildly preserving the beverage."
"8","The quality of water is crucial to the success of a soft drink. Impurities, such as suspended particles, organic matter, and bacteria, may degrade taste and color. They are generally removed through the traditional process of a series of coagulation, filtration, and chlorination. Coagulation involves mixing a gelatinous precipitate, or floc (ferric sulphate or aluminum sulphate), into the water. The floc absorbs suspended particles, making them larger and more easily trapped by filters. During the clarification process, alkalinity must be adjusted with an addition of lime to reach the desired pH level."
"8"," Carbonation is generally added to the finished product, though it may be mixed into the water at an earlier stage. The temperature of the liquid must be carefully controlled since carbon dioxide solubility increases as the liquid temperature decreases. Many carbonators are equipped with their own cooling systems. The amount of carbon dioxide pressure used depends on the type of soft drink. For instance, fruit drinks require far less carbonation than mixer drinks, such as tonics, which are meant to be diluted with other liquids. The beverage is slightly over-pressured with carbon dioxide to facilitate the movement into storage tanks and ultimately to the filler machine."
"8","A soft drink (see terminology for other names) is a drink that typically contains carbonated water (although some lemonades are not carbonated), a sweetener, and a natural or artificial flavoring.

"9","Public health aims to improve the quality of life through prevention and treatment of disease, including mental health. This is done through the surveillance of cases and health indicators, and through the promotion of healthy behaviors. Common public health initiatives include promoting handwashing and breastfeeding, delivery of vaccinations, suicide prevention and distribution of condoms to control the spread of sexually transmitted diseases."
"9","Modern public health practice requires multidisciplinary teams of public health workers and professionals. Teams might include epidemiologists, biostatisticians, medical assistants, public health nurses, midwives or medical microbiologists. Depending on the need environmental health officers or public health inspectors, bioethicists, and even veterinarians might be called on."
"9","Most governments recognize the importance of public health programs in reducing the incidence of disease, disability, and the effects of aging and other physical and mental health conditions, although public health generally receives significantly less government funding compared with medicine.[7] Public health programs providing vaccinations have made strides in promoting health, including the eradication of smallpox, a disease that plagued humanity for thousands of years."
"9","Some programs and policies associated with public health promotion and prevention can be controversial. One such example is programs focusing on the prevention of HIV transmission through safe sex campaigns and needle-exchange programmes. Another is the control of tobacco smoking. Changing smoking behavior requires long-term strategies, unlike the fight against communicable diseases, which usually takes a shorter period for effects to be observed. Many nations have implemented major initiatives to cut smoking, such as increased taxation and bans on smoking in some or all public places."
"9","Public health has early roots in antiquity. From the beginnings of human civilization, it was recognized that polluted water and lack of proper waste disposal spread communicable diseases (theory of miasma).

"9","Poor mental health, stress, anxiety and depression can hit anyone at any time."
"9","Stress and mental health can be a very emotive topic for some and so targeting stress in the workplace can be challenging. It can also be perceived negatively whereas resilience can be seen as a more positive solution. Raising awareness of positive mental health from a resilience perspective can present a good starting point to the wider mental health topic."
"9","Focusing more on resilience opens up both an interesting and educational outlook on how to manage pressure, change and challenge in a way that protects the individual from a negative experience and subsequently enables greater capacity to gain control and continue to perform. Resilient individuals still experience pain, distress, frustration and emotion. However, they have developed the ability to bounce back, re-focus, gain that control and channel their energy in a positive way so as to restore a sense of health and wellbeing."
"9","Living with or experiencing a chronic illness can result in many adjustments and changes, such as loss of independence and not being able to do all the active things you used to do or usually enjoy.

With careful management, the symptoms of anxiety and depression can be treated along with those of many chronic physical illnesses."
"9","A chronic physical illness is an enduring health problem that will not go away – for example diabetes, asthma, arthritis or cancer. Chronic physical illnesses can be managed, but they cannot be cured. People who live with a chronic illness have a greater risk of developing anxiety and/or depression."
